DESIGNING UI : Open mytexteditor.ui file in QT Creator. Drag and Drop a "Text Edit" Input Widget into the editor area. In order to have the text edit widget occupy the whole screen, we add setCentralWidget to the main window.

Add "Text" in menu bar and "Bold" in it. An action is created. Drag the action onto the task bar. Tick checkable for the action.

To add an icon for "Bold" :

Text-Editor -> add New -> Qt -> Qt Resource File (Choose) -> Name (AppResources) & Location (inside Text-Editor) (Next) -> Finish.

In the appresources.qrc file in "Resources", add a prefix \Images and add a file (bold.png) inside Images. "Edit action" of "Bold Action" -> Icon (select)
